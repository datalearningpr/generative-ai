when fine-tuned on a limited medical text dataset. Despite the constraints of a small model size, limited GPU memory, and a dataset of only 500 samples, fine-tuning for just 10 epochs enables the model to acquire nuanced understanding of medical language.\n","\n","***\n","Mistral 7B instruct, though compact, is an extremely capable generative model. Even before fine-tuning, it exhibits some medical knowledge and can provide reasonable medical suggestions. However, its responses resemble those of a general conversational agent rather than a domain expert.\n","\n","```\n","Question:\n","Consistent lower back and neck pains. yes, I've been diagnosed with having a cervical disc herniation since 20 years and a lumbar disc herniation since 12 years. An L2 Nerve block procedure was performed in 11 years back. The last MRI I did was 3 years back.\n","Answer:\n","It sounds like you have been experiencing chronic lower back and neck pain for quite some time, and have been diagnosed with cervical and lumbar disc herniations. Additionally, you have undergone an L2 nerve block procedure in the past. It is important to keep track of your symptoms and any changes in your pain levels, as well as any new developments in your health. It is recommended to speak with a healthcare provider to discuss any treatment options, such as physical therapy, medication, or further medical procedures. Additionally, it is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet, to help manage your pain and improve your overall health.\n","```\n","***\n","\n","However, they way the base model respond to the enqury is like a general AI assistant, not in the scenario we want: a doctor answering online query on the icliniq.com\n","\n","```\n","Question:\n","Hi doctor,\n","I am a healthy person. I have a cough with white sputum production. I do not have a fever. I have done sputum culture. The result showed a presence of Pseudomonas. Do I need an antibiotic?\n","Answer:\n","Hello! I'm an AI, not a doctor, but I can try to answer your question to the best of my abilities. It's great that you've seen a doctor and done a sputum culture, and it's good to know that Pseudomonas was found, as this can be a significant factor in determining whether an antibiotic is necessary.\n","I would recommend discussing the results of your sputum culture and other symptoms with your doctor, who can then provide a more personalized recommendation based on your individual health status and medical history. They may also want to perform additional tests or imaging to better evaluate your condition.\n","Keep in mind that while antibiotics can be effective in treating many bacterial infections, overuse or misuse of antibiotics can lead to antimicrobial resistance, making it difficult to treat certain types of infections in the future. So it's important to only take antibiotics as prescribed by your healthcare provider.\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","***\n","\n","\n","\n","The fine-tuned model convincingly emulates the phrasing, tone, and domain knowledge of real-world medical experts answering consumer health queries online.

I have gone through your health query. Please answer the below health related questions for a better understanding of your health problem and for the appropriate treatment. 1. Itching inside the anus and around the rectal region. 2. Passing soft small hard stools or no stools at all. 3. Feeling fatigue, tiredness and weakness. 4. Constipation since the past 15 days. The probable cause is worm infestation. I would like to guide you with this. Start using the mentioned medicines till you complete the entire treatment course and take the subsequent follow-up consultation again. Take care. Regards.
