The entire chat process is automated. Autogen use cases primarily involve resolving issues related to coding or tools. The examples here aim to demonstrate that by establishing background and roles for different agents, the conversation itself can provide end-users with significant insights.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"9piKevsaECa8"},"outputs":[],"source":["import autogen\n","\n","config_list_gpt4 = [\n","\n","]\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XSFw33tTECa9"},"source":["### Example 1: Debates"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"LNUBU5zWECa9"},"outputs":[],"source":["llm_config = {\"config_list\": config_list_gpt4, \"seed\": 42}\n","user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\n","   name=\"User_proxy\",\n","   system_message=\"A human admin.\",\n","   human_input_mode=\"TERMINATE\"\n",")\n","d1 = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n","    name=\"debater1\",\n","    system_message=\"Strong debater in defending its own opinion.\",\n","    llm_config=llm_config,\n",")\n","d2 = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n","    name=\"debater2\",\n","    system_message=\"Strong debater in defending its own opinion.\",\n","    llm_config=llm_config,\n",")\n","groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy, d1, d2], messages=[], max_round=12)\n","manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat, llm_config=llm_config)\n","\n","\n","user_proxy.initiate_chat(manager, message=\"\"\"\n","Which is More Important: Hard Work or Talent?\n","debater1 think it is hard work.\n","debater2 think it is talent.\n","start the debate.\n","\"\"\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8eVvb-Z_ECa-"},"source":["### Example 2: Content Creation"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"3yxdFbjlECa-"},"outputs":[],"source":["llm_config = {\"config_list\": config_list_gpt4, \"seed\": 42}\n","user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\n","   name=\"User_proxy\",\n","   system_message=\"A human admin.\",\n","   human_input_mode=\"TERMINATE\"\n",")\n","d1 = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n","    name=\"teacher\",\n","    system_message=\"\"\"\n","    Excellent teacher who will teach new technology to non IT major students in university\n","    Each course will have a topic which will last a 3 hours session.\n","    Given a selected topic, you will give out the detailed course outline and materials and how the course will be carried out.\n","    \"\"\",\n","    llm_config=llm_config,\n",")\n","d2 = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n","    name=\"critic\",\n","    system_message=\"\"\"\n","    Excellent course critic who will give comments and suggestion for an given course outline, material and teaching method.\n","    \"\"\",\n","    llm_config=llm_config,\n",")\n","groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy, d1, d2], messages=[], max_round=12)\n","manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat, llm_config=llm_config)\n","\n","user_proxy.initiate_chat(manager, message=\"\"\"\n","we need a new course next month for topic \"Javascript\"\n","\"\"\")\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"flaml","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.4"},"orig_nbformat":4},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
