    "# Fine-Tuning llama 3.1 8B Base Model with Unsloth\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this Notebook, where we embark on a fun and educational journey to fine-tune llama 3.1 8B large language model (LLM) to imitate the charming character of Peppa Pig. Peppa Pig is a beloved children's character known for her adorable adventures and relatable stories. By leveraging the power of transformer-based models, we can create a version of Peppa Pig that not only generates text in her unique voice but also captures her playful spirit and whimsical outlook on life.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will cover the following key topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding the Model and Fine Tuning Library(Unsloth)**: A brief overview of the large language model and fine tuning library we will be using for fine-tuning.\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation**: Transform the scripts into the dataset format which is suitable for fine tuning.\n",
    "3. **Fine-Tuning Process**: Step-by-step instructions on how to train our model using the collected dataset.\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**: Methods to evaluate the performance of our fine-tuned model and ensure it resonates with the original character.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will have a better understanding of the techniques involved in fine-tuning large language models and the creativity that can arise from merging AI with beloved fictional characters."
